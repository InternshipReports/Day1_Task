# Day1_Task
On Day 1, the task was to clean the raw Amazon sales data to prepare it for further analysis. Data cleaning is an essential step to ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and reliable.

Tasks Completed-
1. Removed Duplicates:
   Duplicate rows were identified and removed to avoid repeated data and ensure accuracy in analysis.

2. Assigned Correct Data Types:
   Each column was checked and converted to the appropriate data type. For example, numerical fields were set as integers or floats, date fields were converted to datetime format, and text fields were set as 
   strings.

3. Standardized Date Format:
   All date values were formatted in a consistent way (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) to help with time-based analysis and sorting.

4. Handled Missing Values:
   Missing or null values were identified and handled using different methods such as filling with mean, median, or a placeholder like "Unknown", depending on the type of data. In some cases, rows with too many 
   missing values were removed.

The dataset is now clean and ready for further analysis and visualization.
